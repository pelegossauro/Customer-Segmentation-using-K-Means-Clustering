# Customer-Segmentation-using-K-Means-Clustering

Overview
This project demonstrates how customer segmentation can be performed using the K-Means Clustering algorithm. The goal is to divide a customer base into distinct groups (clusters) based on various attributes such as demographics, purchasing behavior, or other relevant metrics. Segmentation helps businesses better understand their customers and tailor marketing strategies to specific groups.

Introduction
Customer segmentation is an essential task in marketing and business strategy. By segmenting customers into different clusters, businesses can provide personalized experiences, improve customer engagement, and optimize resource allocation. This project uses K-Means Clustering, a popular unsupervised learning technique, to classify customers into meaningful segments based on their behavior.

The K-Means algorithm partitions the data into k clusters, where each customer belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. The project walks through the steps of data preprocessing, applying K-Means, and evaluating the results.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be any customer-related data that includes relevant features for segmentation. Common features might include:

Customer ID
Age
Income
Spending Score
Purchase history
For this project, we are using a sample dataset that includes customer demographics and spending behavior. If you'd like to use your own dataset, ensure it contains the necessary customer features for segmentation.

Example of the dataset (with a few sample columns):
CustomerID	Age	Income	SpendingScore
1	25	50000	45
2	45	80000	60
3	33	35000	35
...	...	...	...
Installation
Requirements
To run the project, you will need the following libraries:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
sklearn
You can install them using pip:

bash
Copiar c贸digo
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Alternatively, you can install all required libraries via a requirements file:

bash
Copiar c贸digo
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copiar c贸digo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-segmentation.git
cd customer-segmentation
Load the dataset: The dataset should be loaded into a Pandas DataFrame from a CSV file or any other suitable format.

Preprocess the data:

Handle missing values.
Standardize the data to ensure all features contribute equally to the distance metric.
Apply K-Means Clustering:

Choose the number of clusters k based on methods such as the Elbow Method or Silhouette Analysis.
Fit the K-Means model and assign cluster labels.
Visualize the results:

Visualize the clusters on a 2D or 3D plot, depending on the features selected for the analysis.
Example code snippet:

python
Copiar c贸digo
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('customer_data.csv')

# Preprocess the data
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data[['Age', 'Income', 'SpendingScore']])

# Apply K-Means clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4, random_state=42)
data['Cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(scaled_data)

# Visualize the clusters
plt.scatter(data['Age'], data['Income'], c=data['Cluster'], cmap='viridis')
plt.xlabel('Age')
plt.ylabel('Income')
plt.title('Customer Segments')
plt.show()
Results and Evaluation
The results of the clustering can be evaluated by various metrics:

Elbow Method: This method helps identify the optimal number of clusters by plotting the sum of squared distances (within-cluster sum of squares) for different values of k.
Silhouette Score: This metric provides an indication of how well-separated the clusters are.
Visualization: Scatter plots or pair plots help visually assess the distinctiveness of the clusters.
After clustering, each customer is assigned to one of the segments, and these segments can be used for targeted marketing strategies, promotions, etc.

Conclusion
Customer segmentation using K-Means clustering provides an effective way to group customers based on similar behavior and attributes. The project demonstrates the practical implementation of unsupervised learning to create actionable insights for businesses.

By analyzing the segmented groups, businesses can create more personalized and targeted strategies, improving customer engagement and overall business performance.
